# 🚀 Deployment Guide

Your documentation is built and ready! Here are your deployment options:

## Current Status

✅ Ready for deployment

## Deployment Options

### 1. 🌐 GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Deploy directly to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy-alt
```

This will:
- Build the documentation
- Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
- Make it live at `https://waffle-id.github.io/main/`

### 2. 🎯 Netlify (Easiest)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag & drop the `dist/` folder
3. Your docs are live instantly!

Or use Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### 3. ▲ Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod dist/
```

### 4. 🌍 Other Static Hosts

Upload the `dist/` folder to:
- **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase deploy`
- **AWS S3**: Upload to S3 bucket
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect GitHub repo
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Built-in preview

### 5. 👀 Local Preview

Preview locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Opens at http://localhost:3000

## What's in the dist/ folder?

## Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# GitHub Pages
npm run deploy-alt

ls -la dist/
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages not updating?
- Check GitHub repo settings > Pages
- Ensure `gh-pages` branch is selected
- Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

### Deploy failed?
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Ensure you're in the right directory
pwd

# Try manual deployment
npm run build-alt
npx gh-pages -d dist
```

### Want a custom domain?
1. Add `CNAME` file to `dist/` with your domain
2. Configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub settings
